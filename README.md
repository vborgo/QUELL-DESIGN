# QUELL-DESIGN
Design: The control units need to be placed into a deep sleep state under various conditions: When not in use for an extended period of time When disconnected from the network When the connection is unstable. Assuming the connection is UDP based how could we assess the stability? Immediately when placed on the charging dock (2 pins for Vchg &amp; GND)  They also need to be woken up under certain conditions: When removed from the charging dock After a short press of one of the buttons  Your task is to design how each of these features may be achieved. Weâ€™d be looking for an understanding of how they can be accomplished on the ESP32 platform, preferably with code stubs to support your answer.
